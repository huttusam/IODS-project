# Regression and model validation

##### I have created a dataset named 'analysis_dataset' from the dataset 'JYTOPKYS3_data'.  
##### The new dataset contains the information of 166 individuals as follows:  

* *gender* (F/M)  
* *age* (in years)  
* *attitude*: an average of answers to 10 different attitude-realted questions about Statistics (Likert scale)  
* *deep*: an average of answers to 12 questions about deep learning styles (Likert scale)  
* *stra*: an average of answers to 8 questions about learning strategies (Likert scale)  
* *surf*: an average of answers to 12 questions about surface learning styles (Likert scale)  
* *points*: the individual's total exam score  

  
##### Notes:
* In the original dataset the variable 'attitude' was a sum of 10 Likert scale values. In the new dataset, the value 'attitude' has been changed back to Likert scale by dividing each value by 10.  
* Observations in the original data, where the total exam score ('points') was 0, have been omitted from the new dataset.  

  
##### Data Files:  
* The original dataset (JYTOPKYS3-data.txt) can be found [here](http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt)  
* The new dataset (analysis_dataset.csv) can be found [here](https://github.com/huttusam/IODS-project/blob/master/data/analysis_dataset.csv)  

##### Script:  
* The R script used to create the new dataset (*with comments explaining the process*) is  [here](https://github.com/huttusam/IODS-project/blob/master/data/create_learning2014.R)  

##### Analysis:

From a scatter plot matrix we can see that 'attitude' correlates with 'points' (see image below).

When we create a regression model of 'attitude' versus 'points', we can see this more clearly (see image below).
