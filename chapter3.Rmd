# Logistic Regression

### Data Wrangling

##### I have created a new dataset 'alcohol-joined' from two datasets of alcohol use habits and background info of Math and Portugese language course students.  

##### Data Files:  
* The original datasets are [student-mat.csv](https://github.com/huttusam/IODS-project/blob/master/data/student-mat.csv) and [student-por.csv](https://github.com/huttusam/IODS-project/blob/master/data/student-por.csv)

* The new dataset is [alcohol-joined.csv](https://github.com/huttusam/IODS-project/blob/master/data/alcohol-joined.csv)  

##### Script:  
* The R script used to create the new dataset (*with comments explaining the process*) is [create_alc.R](https://github.com/huttusam/IODS-project/blob/master/data/create_alc.R)
